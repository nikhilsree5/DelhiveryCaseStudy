- Developed visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn for descriptive analysis, enhancing data insights and decision-makingprocesses.
- Conducted feature engineering to generate actionable insights for Delhivery, resulting in a 15% increase in operational efficiency

# Business Reccomendations

## Review Segmentation Practices: 
- Analyze the causes of segmentation delays and explore solutions such as streamlining processes or increasing vehicle readiness.Utilize advanced GPS and tracking technology to monitor trip progress and identify 
delays in real-time.

## Focus on Major Corridors: 
- Prioritize enhancements on the busiest corridors (Bengaluru-Bengaluru and Bhivandi-Mumbai) to improve average trip times, potentially through dedicated lanes or optimized traffic signals. Provide training for drivers on efficient navigation and time management, particularly for intra-city trips.

## Analyze High-Volume Regions: 
- Given that Karnataka and Maharashtra are the major contributors to trips, consider localized strategies that cater specifically to these states, such as targeted marketing campaigns or improved service offerings.

## Fleet Optimization: 
- Assess fleet composition and utilization to ensure that the right vehicles are used for the appropriate trip types (FTL vs. carting). Explore expanding the FTL fleet if it consistently shows better efficiency. Implement predictive maintenance programs to reduce vehicle downtime and delays.

## Real-time Updates: 
- Improve customer communication by providing real-time updates on trip status and potential delays, which could enhance customer satisfaction and trust.
